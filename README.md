# Improving HTML code to semantics and simplifying CSS code selectors

## Description

This project is about modifying HTML code to semantics so it indicates a better sense of the web structure. It also shortens some of the expressions to make the reading of the code easier.
Second the CSS selectors are unified and simplified to improve better structure and understanding of the webpage coding
The reader will see how the code has been modified in css as current code has been changed to css comments using the /* */ format.

In order to help with the process resources used were semantic HTML, MDN, CSS resource: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php 

Challenges experienced were unifying the different CSS selectors with identical code into one class and selecting relevant words to describe the new selectors. Others included using a feature branch of the main one to work on the code and then unifying it with the main  branch using git commands

A further challenge was rearranging the heirarchy of the file structure to ensure the webpage functioned correctly on git hub pages. This took a few attempts to succeed and therefore understand. 

git restore . is a very useful feature as it allows a re-start without having to find where the code went wrong - a time saver.
